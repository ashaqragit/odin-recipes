    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Kabsa is an amazingly flavored rice dish that can be made with chicken,
      beef or lamb. An aromatic rice pilaf, a one pot meal from the Arabian
      peninsula. It is like having a flavorful rice and chicken kebab, all made
      in one pot. An exotic Saudi rice dish served with raisins and almonds in
      holidays and any festive season.

        In a non stick deep skillet or a dutch oven, heat oil / ghee or butter
        and toast spices until fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>Add garlic and onion. Saute until translucent.</li>
      <li>
        Add chicken thighs and cook for about 2 minutes on each side until no
        longer pink from outside.
      </li>
      <li>Add rice, tomato paste and check seasonings.</li>
      <li>Mix everything well together.</li>
      <li>Add water or chicken broth if using and cook rice until done.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Instant Pot Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Turn on the IP on the saute option melt ghee then add the spices and
        toast for a couple of minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add garlic and onions and continue to saute until translucent or for
        about 3 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add chicken and cook for about 5 minutes on both sides or until no
        longer pink.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix in rice, tomato paste and salt. Stir well, bringing chicken pieces
        to top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Close the lid and turn it to pressure cook for 8 minutes. When it is
        done let it natural release for 5 minutes then release the rest
        manually. Now it might give you the burn warning. I've used less water,
        1.5 cups of water for 1 cup of rice. This water ratio is high as most
        people recommend 1:1. My IP did not give me the burn warning, rice was a
        little bit mushy but no one complained. I've had a follower message me
        that when it gave them the burn warning, they turned their pot off,
        scraped the bottom then turned it on again and it worked just fine.
